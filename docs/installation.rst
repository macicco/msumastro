Installation
=============

Python
------

This software requires a python distribution that includes numpy other packages vthat support scientific work with python. The easiest way to get this is to download and install the `Anaconda python distribution <http://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Note that the Anaconda distribution includes ``astropy``.

Additional external packages
----------------------------

+ ``astropysics``: Install with: ``pip install --pre astropysics``. Note that you need to use the ``--pre`` argument to make this work.
+ If you want to be able to build the documentation you will need ``sphinx-argpares``: Install it this way: ``pip install sphinx-argparse``
